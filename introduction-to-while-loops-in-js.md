### While syntax

The while loop is ideal when you want to use a loop, but you don't know how many times you'll have to execute that loop.


As long as the condition evaluates totrue, the loop will continue to run. As soon as it's false, it'll stop. (When you use a number in a condition, as we did earlier, JavaScript understands 1 to mean true and 0 to mean false.)
