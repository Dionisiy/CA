## **What is JavaScript, really?**

[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript "JavaScript: JavaScript (JS) is a programming language mostly used client-side to dynamically script webpages, but often also server-side.") \("JS" for short\) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that, when applied to an [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML "HTML: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure.") document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites. It was invented by Brendan Eich, co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.



JavaScript itself is fairly compact but very flexible, and developers have written a lot of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, to unlock a huge amount of extra functionality with very little effort. These include:

* Application Programming Interfaces \([APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/API "APIs: An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of features and rules allowing interaction between the software providing the API and other software components. In Web development, API commonly means a set of standard methods, properties, events, and URLs for interacting with Web content.")\) built into web browsers, providing various functionality like dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles, grabbing and manipulating a video stream from the user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
* Third-party APIs to allow developers to incorporate functionality in their sites from other properties, such as Twitter or Facebook.
* Third-party frameworks and libraries you can apply to your HTML to allow you to rapidly build up sites and applications.
