## **Basics**

JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, but is also influenced by Awk, Perl and Python.

JavaScript is **case-sensitive** and uses the **Unicode** character set.



In JavaScript, instructions are called [statements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Statement "statements: Technical review completed.") and are separated by a semicolon \(;\). Spaces, tabs and newline characters are called whitespace. The source text of JavaScript scripts gets scanned from left to right and is converted into a sequence of input elements which are tokens, control characters, line terminators, comments or whitespace. ECMAScript also defines certain keywords and literals and has rules for automatic insertion of semicolons \([ASI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Automatic_semicolon_insertion)\) to end statements. However, it is recommended to always add semicolons to end your statements; it will avoid side effects. For more information, see the detailed reference about JavaScript's [lexical grammar](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar).

## **Comments**

The syntax of **comments** is the same as in C++ and in many other languages:
