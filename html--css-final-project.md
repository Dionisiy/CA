# Final Project

This final project builds off the skills you learned in the HTML & CSS course. It’s the of the final projects in your track, and one you’ll continue to go back to as you work your way through your Codecademy path.

## How To Use This Guide

This final project is different from the other work you’ve done on Codecademy in two important ways:

* You’ll build locally, from your computer, instead of on Codecademy.
* We’ll provide much less step by step instruction.


## Keep In Mind:

1. What are the goals\/objectives of my site?
2. What content would help accomplish those goals? ex: “About Me” section, work samples, contact information.
3. What **design** features would help me accomplish my goals? ex: color scheme, high quality photos, icons, logo.
4. What **development** features would help me accomplish my goals? ex: page elements, site navigation.
