# **Getting Started with Programming**

Computers only speak certain languages, like the one you've been using today: JavaScript!

### **Editor and comments**

The `//` sign is for **comments**. A comment is a line of text that JavaScript won't try to run as code. It's just for humans to read.

Comments make your program easier to understand. When you look back at your code or others want to collaborate with you, they can read your comments and easily figure out what your code does.



### **What am I learning?**

This is JavaScript \(JS\), a programming language. There are many languages, but JS has many uses and is easy to learn.
