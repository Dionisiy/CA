All websites use HTML and CSS. After learning both of these languages, you will be ready to build your own website!

* _HTML_ stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to give websites structure with text, links, images, and other fundamental elements.




* _CSS_ stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to change the appearance of HTML elements.




```
<h1>You're Building a Website!</h1>
```

1. All HTML elements begin with an _opening tag_. In this case, the opening tag is `<h1>`.




2. Most elements require a _closing tag_, denoted by a `/`. In this case, the closing tag is `</h1>`.




3. The website user only sees the content between the opening and closing tags.
