# HTML and CSS

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. Hypertext means "text wth links in it".

A markup language is a programming language used to make text do more than just sit on a page: it can turn text into  images, links, tables, lists and much more.


            

            
            <!DOCTYPE HTML>            
            <html>
                <head>
                </head>
                <body>

                    <p>this is a tag paragraph</p>

                </body>
            </html>







1. Things inside `<>`s are called **tags**.
2. Tags nearly always come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.

3. Example of opening tag: &lt;html&gt;


Always put `<!DOCTYPE html>` on the first line. This tells the browser what language it's reading \(in this case, HTML\).
