# Final Project

This final project builds off the skills you learned in the HTML & CSS course. It’s the of the final projects in your track, and one you’ll continue to go back to as you work your way through your Codecademy path.



## How To Use This Guide

This final project is different from the other work you’ve done on Codecademy in two important ways:

* You’ll build locally, from your computer, instead of on Codecademy.
* We’ll provide much less step by step instruction.
