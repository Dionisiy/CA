# **What are tables?**

Tables are very useful. We use them to store tabular data so it is easy to read! When you want to present information neatly in a table with rows and columns—you guessed it—the `<table>`tag is what you need.

A table is just a bunch of information arranged in rows and columns.

We use the `<tr>` tag to create a **table row**. We'll learn how to create columns shortly, and everything will start to come together.

```
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Table Time</title>
    </head>

    <body>

        <table>
            <tr></tr>
            <!-- Add two more rows below this! -->
            <tr></tr>
            <tr></tr>

        </table>

    </body>

</html>
```



To make our table look a little more like a table, we'll use the `<thead>` and`<tbody>` tags. These go within the`<table>` tag and stand for **t**able head and **t**able body, respectively.
