CSS is a language used to style websites. Colors, fonts, and page layouts for a site can all be managed using CSS. The more comfortable you are with CSS, the better equipped you will be to create stylish and contemporary-looking websites.



1. _rule_: a list of CSS instructions for how to style a specific HTML element or group of HTML elements.





2. _selector_: specifies exactly which HTML elements to style. Here `h1` is the selector.





3. _properties_ and _values_: located inside the `{ }`brackets, properties and values specify what aspect of the selector to style. In the diagram's example, the `color` property is set to `red`, which will display all `h1` elements in red.
