# **Selecting Elements**

The most basic concept of jQuery is to "select some elements and do something with them." jQuery supports most CSS3 selectors, as well as some non-standard selectors. For a complete selector reference, visit the [Selectors documentation on api.jquery.com](http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/).

## **Selecting Elements by ID**

```
$( "#myId" ); // Note IDs must be unique per page.
```

## **Selecting Elements by Class Name**



```
$( ".myClass" );
```
