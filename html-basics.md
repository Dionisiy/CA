# HTML and CSS

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. Hypertext means "text wth links in it".

A markup language is a programming language used to make text do more than just sit on a page: it can turn text into images, links, tables, lists and much more.

Here is a example of HTML

```auto
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
    </head>

    <body>
    </body>

</html>

```

1. Things inside `<>`s are called **tags.**

2. Tags nearly always come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.

3. Example of opening tag: &lt;html&gt;


> Always put `<!DOCTYPE html>` on the first line. This tells the browser what language it's reading \(in this case, HTML\).

### **Make the head**

There are always two parts to an HTML file: the head and the body. Let's start with the head.

The head contains information about your HTML file, like its title. The title is what we see in the browser's title bar or page tab.

### **Paragraphs in the body**

The body is where you put your content, such as text, images, and links. The content in the body is what will be visible on the actual page.

`jsconst ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO'`

```auto
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html> 
<head> 
    <title> my webpage</title> 
</head> 
<body>
  <p>Hello, World!</p> 
  <p>This is a paragraph</p>  
</body>

</html> 
```



### **Paragraphs and headings**

HTML actually lets us have more than one heading size. There are six heading sizes:

* `<h1>` - The CEO
* `<h2>` - VP
* `<h3>` - Director
* `<h4>` - Middle management
* `<h5>` - Lowly assistant
* `<h6>` - Gets coffee for everyone 

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>
			Headings & Paragraphs
		</title>
		
	</head>
	<body>
		
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
	<p>This is a paragraph</p>
	
	<h2>This is a heading</h2>
	<p>This is a paragraph</p>
	
	<h3>This is a heading</h3>
	<p>This is a paragraph</p>
	
	<h4>This is a heading</h4>
	<p>This is a paragraph</p>
	
	<h5>This is a heading</h5>
	<p>This is a paragraph</p>
	
	<h6>This is a heading</h6>
	<p>This is a paragraph</p>
	</body>
</html>
```
