# CSS: An Overview

### **What CSS is**

CSS \(which stands for **C**ascading **S**tyle**S**heets\) is a language used to describe the appearance and formatting of your HTML.

A **style sheet** is a file that describes how an HTML file should look. That's it!

We say these style sheets are cascading because the sheets can apply formatting when more than one style applies.
