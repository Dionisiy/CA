## **CSS Positioning**

Controlling the position of HTML elements allows you incredibly fine control over how your pages look. No longer will your `<div>`s sit directly on top of one another! \(Unless you want them to.\)

As we mentioned, elements populate the page in what's known as the **CSS box model**. Each HTML element is like a tiny box or container that holds the pictures and text you specify.
