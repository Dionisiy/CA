[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript "JavaScript: JavaScript (JS) is a programming language mostly used client-side to dynamically script webpages, but often also server-side.") \("JS" for short\) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that, when applied to an [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML "HTML: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure.") document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites. It was invented by Brendan Eich, co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.
