# CSS: An Overview

### **What CSS is**

CSS \(which stands for **C**ascading **S**tyle**S**heets\) is a language used to describe the appearance and formatting of your HTML.

A **style sheet** is a file that describes how an HTML file should look. That's it!

We say these style sheets are cascading because the sheets can apply formatting when more than one style applies.

### **Why separate form from function?**

There are two main reasons for separating your form\/formatting \(CSS\) from your functional content\/structure \(HTML\):

1. You can apply the same formatting to several HTML elements without rewriting code \(_e.g._ `style="color:red":`\) over and over
2. You can apply similar appearance and formatting to several HTML pages from a single CSS file
