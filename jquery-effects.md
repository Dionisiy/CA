### **More Practice with .animate\(\)**

Let's get in a little more look on  `.animate()` effect. That's the one with the slightly more complicated inputâ€”if we wanted to move a div 10 pixels down, we'd type something like

```
$('div').animate({top:'+=10px'},500);
```

Where the bit between curly braces says "hey, jQuery! Add 10 pixels to the current top margin," and the second input says "do it in 500 milliseconds!" \(1,000 milliseconds = one second.\)
