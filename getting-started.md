### Getting Started with Programming

Computers only speak certain languages, like the one you've been using today: JavaScript!

### Editor and comments

The`//` sign is for comments. A comment is a line of text that JavaScript won't try to run as code. It's just for humans to read.

Comments make your program easier to understand. When you look back at your code or others want to collaborate with you, they can read your comments and easily figure out what your code does.

### What am I learning?

This is JavaScript \(JS\), a programming language. There are many languages, but JS has many uses and is easy to learn.

What can we use JavaScript for?

* make websites respond to user interaction

* build apps and games \(\_e.g.\_blackjack\)

* access information on the Internet \(e.g. find out the top trending words on Twitter by topic\)

* organize and present data \(\_e.g.\_automate spreadsheet work; data visualization\)


`confirm('This is an example of using JS to create some interaction on a website. Click OK to continue!');`

### Interactive JavaScript

`confirm("I feel awesome!");`

`confirm("I am ready to go.");`

These boxes can be used on websites to confirm things with users. You've probably seen them pop up when you try to delete important things or leave a website with unsaved changes.

### **What is programming?**

Programming is like writing a list of instructions to the computer so it can do cool stuff with your information.

To do any of actions, the program needs an input. You can ask for input with a **prompt**.

Examples:

`prompt("What is your name?");`

`prompt("What is Ubuntu?")`
