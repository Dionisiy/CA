###The Document Object Model


To get the most out of jQuery, we should review how an HTML page is put together.

An HTML document is structured according to the Document Object Model, or DOM. It's by interacting with the DOM that jQuery is able to access and modify HTML.

The DOM consists of every element on the page, laid out in a hierarchical way that reflects the way the HTML document is ordered. Remember how we could think of the HTML document as a tree? You can think of the DOM the same way. Just as with an HTML document, elements in the DOM can have parents, children, and siblings.
