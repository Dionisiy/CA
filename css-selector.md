## **All HTML elements are selectors**



We've used a number of HTML elements as CSS selectors so far: we've styled the HTML tags `<h1></h1>` with the CSS selector `h1`, `<p></p>` with `p`, and so on.

Any HTML element can be a CSS selector! You can modify`<ul>`s, `<table>`s, and even the entire`<body>` by selecting `ul`, `table`, and`body`, respectively.
