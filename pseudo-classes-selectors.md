## **Information: Selectors**

CSS has its own terminology to describe the CSS language. Previously in this tutorial, you created a line in your stylesheet like this:

```
strong {
  color: red;
}
```

In CSS terminology, this entire line is a _rule_. This rule starts with `strong`, which is a _selector_. It selects which elements in the DOM the rule applies to.
