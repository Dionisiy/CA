# Introduction to HTML

Nowadays, webpage designers have access to hundreds of different fonts, font sizes, colors, and even alphabets and browsers can for the most part display them accurately.  Webpages may also contain images, video clips, and background music. They may include drop-down menus, search boxes, or links you can follow to access other pages \(whether on the same site or another site\).



A typical webpage depends on several technologies \(such as [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS "CSS"), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/About_JavaScript "JavaScript/About_JavaScript"), [AJAX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX "AJAX"), [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JSON "JSON")\) to control what the end-user sees, but most fundamentally, developers write webpages in [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML "HTML"), without which there can be no webpages. To display the page on the client-side device, a browser starts out by reading the HTML.



The [HTML specification](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/ "http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/") defines a single language that can be written either with the relaxed [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML "HTML: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure.") syntax or the stricter [XML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/XML "XML: eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a generic markup language specified by the W3C. The information technology (IT) industry uses many languages based on XML as data-description languages.") syntax \([Extensible Markup Language](http://www.w3.org/XML/ "http://www.w3.org/XML/")\). HTML also addresses the needs of Web apps. HTML only describes the meaning of the content, not style and formatting. To define appearance and layout, please use [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS "CSS: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a declarative language that controls how webpages look in the browser."), not explicit presentational [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML "HTML: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure.").
