###The Document Object Model


To get the most out of jQuery, we should review how an HTML page is put together.

An HTML document is structured according to the Document Object Model, or DOM. It's by interacting with the DOM that jQuery is able to access and modify HTML.

The DOM consists of every element on the page, laid out in a hierarchical way that reflects the way the HTML document is ordered. Remember how we could think of the HTML document as a tree? You can think of the DOM the same way. Just as with an HTML document, elements in the DOM can have parents, children, and siblings.


###Changing Targets


###What is jQuery?

jQuery is a library, or set of helpful add-ons, to the JavaScriptprogramming language. It may seem counterintuitive to learn how to use a library before learning the actual language, but there are a few good reasons for this.

- It takes a while to become comfortable with JavaScript, and it's trickier to manipulate HTML elements directly with JavaScript than with jQuery. In order to help you build awesome websites faster, we're starting you off with jQuery.

- jQuery provides a simple interface for the underlying JavaScript. It's easier for many users to learn jQuery first, then dive into the nitty-gritty JavaScript details later.

- jQuery is much better at giving you immediate, visual results than regular JavaScript. By the end of this lesson, you'll have built your own interactive button!
