### **Fun with Functions**

Recall that we can add methods \(i.e., functions associated with objects\) to a constructor:

```
function someObject() {

  this.someMethod = function() {
  };

}
```



Suppose we said `var someObj = newsomeObject();`. When we call`someObj.someMethod()`, the code between the curly brackets `{ }` above will run.
