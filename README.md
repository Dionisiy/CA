# Using HTML5 audio and video

HTML5 introduces built-in media support via the `<audio>` and `<video>` elements, offering the ability to easily embed media into HTML documents.

## **Embedding media**

Embedding media in your HTML document is trivial:

```
<video src="http://v2v.cc/~j/theora_testsuite/320x240.ogg" controls>
  Your browser does not support the <code>video</code> element.
</video>
```

This example plays a sample video, with playback controls.
