## Boundares and Space I

An important part of styling a webpage with CSS is organizing boundaries and space.

Every page element has boundary and space properties that can be controlled using CSS.

1. _content_: Includes text, images, or other media contained within an HTML element.

2. _padding_: The space between the content and the border. You can think of this like inner space.

3. _border_: The outline of an HTML page element. You can think of it like a picture frame that contains the element.

4. _margin_: The space between the HTML page element and the next nearest element\(s\).





### Border

The _border_ property can be used to visually define a page element's outer edge.

In CSS, the _border_ property's value requires three parts:

1. _thickness_: Sets the thickness of the border, using pixels, ems, or rems.

2. _type_: Sets the border type. Common options are`solid`, `dotted`, and `dashed`. There are many others.

3. _color_: sets the border's color, using named colors, HEX, or RGB values.
