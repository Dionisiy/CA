## **Information: Selectors**

CSS has its own terminology to describe the CSS language. Previously in this tutorial, you created a line in your stylesheet like this:

```
strong {
  color: red;
}
```

In CSS terminology, this entire line is a _rule_. This rule starts with `strong`, which is a _selector_. It selects which elements in the DOM the rule applies to.

> **More details**
> The part inside the curly braces is the declaration.
> 
> The keyword color is a property, and red is a value.
> 
> The semicolon after the property-value pair separates it from other property-value pairs in the same declaration.
> 
> This tutorial refers to a selector like strong as a tag selector. The CSS Specification refers to it as a type selector.
