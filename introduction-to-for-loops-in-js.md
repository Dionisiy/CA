**First for loop**

Instead of manually typing in`console.log` ,many times, we can use a`for` loop to do this. The aim of this exercise is just to show you how a `for`loop looks, and demonstrate how useful it is. Subsequent exercises will

a. walk you through the syntax bit by bit

b. explain how the computer thinks as it executes a `for` loop.
