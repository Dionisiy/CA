# Introduction to Object-Oriented JavaScript



### **Object-oriented programming**

Object-oriented programming \(OOP\) is a programming paradigm that uses [abstraction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/abstraction "abstraction: Abstraction in computer programming is a way to reduce complexity and allow efficient design and implementation in complex software systems. It hides the technical complexity of systems behind simpler APIs.") to create models based on the real world. OOP uses several techniques from previously established paradigms, including [modularity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/modularity "modularity: The term Modularity refers to the degree to which a system's components may be separated and recombined, it is also division of a software package into logical units. The advantage of a modular system is that one can reason the parts independently"), [polymorphism](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/polymorphism "polymorphism: Polymorphism is the presentation of one interface for multiple data types.
 For example, integers, floats, and doubles are implicitly polymorphic: regardless of their different types, they can all be added, subtracted, multiplied, and so on."), and [encapsulation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/encapsulation "encapsulation: Encapsulation is the packing of data and functions into one component (for example, a class) and then controlling access to that component to make a "blackbox" out of the object. Because of this, a user of that class only needs to know its interface (that is, the data and functions exposed outside the class), not the hidden implementation."). Today, many popular programming languages \(such as Java, JavaScript, C\#, C++, Python, PHP, Ruby and Objective-C\) support OOP.



OOP envisions software as a collection of cooperating objects rather than a collection of functions or simply a list of commands \(as is the traditional view\). In OOP, each object can receive messages, process data, and send messages to other objects. Each object can be viewed as an independent little machine with a distinct role or responsibility.
