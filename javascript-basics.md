## **What is JavaScript, really?**

[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript "JavaScript: JavaScript (JS) is a programming language mostly used client-side to dynamically script webpages, but often also server-side.") \("JS" for short\) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that, when applied to an [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML "HTML: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure.") document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites. It was invented by Brendan Eich, co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.

JavaScript itself is fairly compact but very flexible, and developers have written a lot of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, to unlock a huge amount of extra functionality with very little effort. These include:

* Application Programming Interfaces \([APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/API "APIs: An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of features and rules allowing interaction between the software providing the API and other software components. In Web development, API commonly means a set of standard methods, properties, events, and URLs for interacting with Web content.")\) built into web browsers, providing various functionality like dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles, grabbing and manipulating a video stream from the user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
* Third-party APIs to allow developers to incorporate functionality in their sites from other properties, such as Twitter or Facebook.
* Third-party frameworks and libraries you can apply to your HTML to allow you to rapidly build up sites and applications.

However, JavaScript is a bit more complex to get comfortable with than HTML and CSS, and you'll have to start small, and keep working at it in tiny regular steps. To start off with, we'll show you how to add some really basic JavaScript to your page, to create a "hello world!" example \([the standard in basic programming examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)\).

### Variables

[Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Variable "Variables: A variable is a named location for storing a value. That way an unpredictable value can be accessed through a predetermined name.") are containers that you can store values in. You start by declaring a variable with the`var` keyword, followed by any name you want to call it:

```
var myVariable;
```

> **Note**: All statements in JavaScript must end with a semi-colon, to indicate that this is where the statement ends. If you don't include these, you can get unexpected results.
> 
> **Note**: You can name a variable nearly anything, but there are some name restrictions \(see [this article on variable naming rules](http://www.codelifter.com/main/tips/tip_020.shtml).\) If you are unsure, you can [check your variable name](https://mothereff.in/js-variables) to see if it is valid.
> 
> **Note**: JavaScript is case sensitive â€” `myVariable` is a different variable to `myvariable`. If you are getting problems in your code, check the casing!
