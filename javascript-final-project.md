#JavaScript Final Project


###Introduction

There are a lot of theories out there about the best way to learn to program. If there’s one thing almost everyone agrees on, it’s that there’s no substitute for actually building something. Putting together projects from scratch is the single best way to cement your skills (and show them off), and an important early experience for anyone serious about learning to code.

This final project builds off the skills you learned in the Javascript course, and also pre-supposes knowledge of jQuery. If you haven’t worked your way through the jQuery course on Codecademy, do that before starting this project (don’t worry, it’s much quicker than the Javascript track!).

In this project, you’ll build a game from scratch. You’ll leave Codecademy’s learning environment and build locally, on your own computer, testing and running the game in the browser.
