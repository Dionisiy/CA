### Introduction to Objects

The very basic building block of JavaScript are primitive data types. We know of three primitives:

* **strings** \(_e.g._ `"dogs go woof!"`\)
* **numbers** \(_e.g._ `4`, `10`\)
* **booleans** \(_e.g._ `false`, `5 > 4`\)

Arrays filled with objects will work just like arrays filled with numbers and strings.

In the same way we may loop through an array of numbers to print them out or calculate a sum, we can loop through an array of objects and access properties or methods.

We know two ways of storing data types. We can use variables or arrays. We use variables to store data \(like strings or numbers\) that we’d later want to access.

An array is exactly the same as a variable in that it stores data. The difference is that an array can store many more values while a variable can only store one.

To access arrays, we use bracket notation and remember that arrays use 0-based indexing \(i.e., the first value in an array is at position 0\).





data type: **objects**. This data type is a little bit more complex. Objects allow us to represent in code real world things and entities \(such as a person or bank account\). We do this by storing all relevant information in one place—an object.



Let's review what we previously covered. Each piece of information we include in an object is known as a**property**. Think of a property like a**category label** that belongs to some object. When creating an object, each property has a name, followed by `:`and then the **value** of that property.
