# Introduction to HTML

Nowadays, webpage designers have access to hundreds of different fonts, font sizes, colors, and even alphabets and browsers can for the most part display them accurately.  Webpages may also contain images, video clips, and background music. They may include drop-down menus, search boxes, or links you can follow to access other pages \(whether on the same site or another site\).
