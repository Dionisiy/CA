# Attributes

## **class**

HTML elements can have one or more classes, separated by spaces. You can style elements using CSS by selecting them with their classes.

**Example**

```
<div class="big-box yellow-box">This is a big yellow box.</div>

```

## **id**

An HTML element can have an id attribute to identify it. id elements should always be unique to that single element, and each element should never have more than one id.

**Example**

```
<div id="my-box">This is my box! Put your text in some other box.</div>

```

## **href**

Links tell the browser where to go using an href attribute, which stores a URL.

**Example**

```
<a href="http://google.com">Google it!</a>

```

# Basic Formatting

You can easily format text to be bold, italic, or underlined using simple formatting tags.
