# How does the Internet work?

> **This article discusses what the Internet is and how it works.**

The **Internet** is the backbone of the Web, the technical infrastructure that makes the Web possible. At its most basic, the Internet is a large network of computers which communicate all together.

When two computers need to communicate, you have to link them, either physically or wirelessly. Each computer on a network is connected to a special tiny computer called a _router_.

_Router_ makes sure that a message sent from a given computer arrives at the right destination computer. To send a message to computer B, computer A must send the message to the router, which in turn forwards the message to computer B and makes sure the message is not delivered to computer

By connecting computers to routers, then routers to routers, we are able to scale infinitely

To do that, we will connect our network to an Internet Service Provider \(ISP\). An ISP is a company that manages some special _routers_ that link all together and can also access other ISPs' routers. So the message from our network is carried through the network of ISP networks to the destination network. The Internet consists of this whole infrastructure of networks.



If you want to send a message to a computer, you have to specify which one. Thus any computer linked to a network has a unique address to identify it, called an "IP address" \(where IP stands for_Internet Protocol_\). It's an address made of a series of four numbers separated by dots, for example: `192.168.2.10`.
