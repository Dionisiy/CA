# Final Project

This final project builds off the skills you learned in the HTML & CSS course. It’s the of the final projects in your track, and one you’ll continue to go back to as you work your way through your Codecademy path.

## How To Use This Guide

This final project is different from the other work you’ve done on Codecademy in two important ways:

* You’ll build locally, from your computer, instead of on Codecademy.
* We’ll provide much less step by step instruction.

## Keep In Mind:

1. What are the goals\/objectives of my site?
2. What content would help accomplish those goals? ex: “About Me” section, work samples, contact information.
3. What **design** features would help me accomplish my goals? ex: color scheme, high quality photos, icons, logo.
4. What **development** features would help me accomplish my goals? ex: page elements, site navigation.


## Creating A Wireframe



Before you start writing code, you should attempt to wireframe the website. It’s much easier to think through your design options on a piece of paper or a design application like Photoshop than it is to do this while writing new code. Setting up a wireframe in advance will help you organize your process by making a key decisions about the project before writing any HTML.



Don’t worry, you don’t need design experience to make a wireframe. You don’t even need drawing skills. Just grab a piece of paper and start sketching! Wireframes are easiest to make in black and white, and only need to be about as detailed as the image below. Notice that this wireframe was used to make the Portfolio Example 1 design above.
