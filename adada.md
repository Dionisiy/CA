>##### Note on Boilerplate

>You don't have to define action type constants in a separate file, or even to define them at all. For a small project, it might be easier to just use string literals for action types. However, there are some benefits to explicitly declaring constants in larger codebases. Read [Reducing Boilerplate](../recipes/ReducingBoilerplate.md) for more practical tips on keeping your codebase clean.


Finished reading the article? Let's recount their differences:

<table> <thead> <tr> <th></th> <th scope="col" style="text-align:left">Presentational Components</th> <th scope="col" style="text-align:left">Container Components</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <th scope="row" style="text-align:right">Purpose</th> <td>How things look (markup, styles)</td> <td>How things work (data fetching, state updates)</td> </tr> <tr> <th scope="row" style="text-align:right">Aware of Redux</th> <td>No</th> <td>Yes</th> </tr> <tr> <th scope="row" style="text-align:right">To read data</th> <td>Read data from props</td> <td>Subscribe to Redux state</td> </tr> <tr> <th scope="row" style="text-align:right">To change data</th> <td>Invoke callbacks from props</td> <td>Dispatch Redux actions</td> </tr> <tr> <th scope="row" style="text-align:right">Are written</th> <td>By hand</td> <td>Usually generated by React Redux</td> </tr> </tbody></table>

Most of the components we'll write will be presentational, but we'll need to generate a few container components to connect them to the Redux store.
