### **Launching Code on Document Ready**

To run code as soon as the document is ready to be manipulated, jQuery has a statement known as the [ready event](http://api.jquery.com/ready/):

```
$( document ).ready(function() {

    // Your code here.

});
```

> Note: The jQuery library exposes its methods and properties via two properties of the window object called jQuery and $. $ is simply an alias for jQuery and it's often employed because it's shorter and faster to write.
