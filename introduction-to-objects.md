### Introduction to Objects

The very basic building block of JavaScript are primitive data types. We know of three primitives:

* **strings** \(_e.g._ `"dogs go woof!"`\)
* **numbers** \(_e.g._ `4`, `10`\)
* **booleans** \(_e.g._ `false`, `5 > 4`\)

Arrays filled with objects will work just like arrays filled with numbers and strings.

In the same way we may loop through an array of numbers to print them out or calculate a sum, we can loop through an array of objects and access properties or methods.
