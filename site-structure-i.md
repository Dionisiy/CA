All websites use HTML and CSS. After learning both of these languages, you will be ready to build your own website!

* _HTML_ stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to give websites structure with text, links, images, and other fundamental elements.

* _CSS_ stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to change the appearance of HTML elements.


```
<h1>You're Building a Website!</h1>
```

* All HTML elements begin with an _opening tag_. In this case, the opening tag is `<h1>`.

* Most elements require a _closing tag_, denoted by a `/`. In this case, the closing tag is `</h1>`.

* The website user only sees the content between the opening and closing tags.


Headings are a frequently used HTML element. You can think of them like headlines in a newspaper. Your eyes may notice headings first because the words are large and bold compared to other text on the webpage.

There are six heading elements: `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`,`h5`, and `h6`. `h1` is the largest heading and `h6` is the smallest.

The HTML _paragraph_ element, `p`, is used to hold one or more sentences, just like paragraphs in an essay or a book.

```
<p>Paragraph text here</p>
```

What if you wanted to link users to a different webpage? The HTML _anchor_ element makes it possible to do this with a single click.

`<a href="http://google.com"> Click here for Google!</a>`

Anchor elements use an _attribute_ to link users to websites. Attributes customize the behavior or appearance of HTML elements. Anchor elements use the `href` attribute, which specifies the webpage to link to.
